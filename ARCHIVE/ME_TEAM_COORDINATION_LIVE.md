## 🔄 HANDOFF COORDINATION PROCESS

### Handoff Workflow (For Each Document)

**Stage 1: Submission** (Team → ME)
- Team completes document in their working directory
- Team saves to root: `/home/cjnf/Bump U/[FILENAME].md`
- Team notifies ME (DM or #documentation post)
- **Timeline**: < 2 min notification lag

**Stage 2: Review** (ME)
- ME reads document within 30 min of submission
- ME checks:
  - Line count target met?
  - Structure follows template?
  - Content is accurate?
  - No critical issues?
- **Timeline**: 30 min review window

**Stage 3: Feedback or Approval** (ME → Team)
- If ✅ APPROVED: Document marked ready, team notified
- If 🔴 FEEDBACK: Specific items for revision, team given 30 min to fix
- **Timeline**: < 5 min notification

**Stage 4: Resubmission (if needed)** (Team → ME)
- Team fixes specific feedback items
- Team resubmits updated file
- ME re-reviews within 15 min
- **Timeline**: 15 min final review

**Stage 5: Final Handoff** (ME)
- Document approved and locked for publishing
- Document added to consolidation queue
- Team notified: ready for next assignment
- **Timeline**: Immediate

## 📈 PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Why Parallel Execution Works Here
- **No interdependencies**: Each team's docs are independent
- **Parallel submission**: All teams submit simultaneously
- **Rolling review**: ME reviews while others are still writing
- **Staggered completion**: Different teams finish at different times
- **Maximum throughput**: 13 documents completed in 6-7 hours total

### Coordination Mechanics
1. **Gameplay team**: Fastest (1 doc, 90-120 min) → Finishes ~2 PM
2. **UI team**: 3 docs parallel (150 min total) → Finishes ~1:15 PM
3. **Board team**: 3 docs parallel (195 min total) → Finishes ~1:45 PM
4. **Build team**: 3 docs parallel (195 min total) → Finishes ~1:45 PM
5. **QA team**: 3 docs parallel (225 min total) → Finishes ~2:15 PM

**Total submission window**: 12:30 PM - 2:15 PM UTC (all docs in by deadline)

### Review Overlaps
- While Gameplay writes (12:30-2:00 PM), UI finishes early (1:15 PM) → ME reviews
- While Board writes (12:30-1:45 PM), UI docs complete → rolling review
- While Build writes (12:30-1:45 PM), QA starts → rolling review continues
- All 13 reviewed by 8:00 PM UTC

## 🚨 ESCALATION & BLOCKERS

### If Team Submits Early (Before 1 PM)
**Action**: Immediate praise + fast-track review  
**Priority**: ME reviews within 15 min (accelerated)  
**Impact**: Team can take break or help other team if blocked  

### If Team Falls Behind (No submission by 2 PM)
**Action**: ME checks in at 2 PM UTC  
**Options**:
1. Call team, understand blocker (5 min)
2. Provide guidance or example (5-10 min)
3. Reduce scope negotiation (if necessary)
4. Coordinate help from related team (if needed)

### If Team Document is Incomplete
**Action**: ME provides targeted feedback  
**Options**:
1. If 80%+ complete: Approve with note to finish in next sprint
2. If 50-80%: Request specific additions, 30 min fix
3. If <50%: Scope reduction negotiation + extended time

### If ME Review Queue Backs Up (3+ docs waiting)
**Action**: Fast-track process  
**Priority**: Approve good docs (80%+), request revision for others  
**Parallel**: Use secondary reviewer if available  

### If Team Blocks Another Team's Work
**Action**: ME mediates immediately  
**Example**: Board team needs Gameplay info mid-document  
**Solution**: ME provides data or facilitates quick sync
