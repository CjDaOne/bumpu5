## Quality Framework Established

### Code Standards (Mandatory)
✅ Naming conventions (classes, methods, fields)  
✅ Documentation standards (XML comments)  
✅ Testing standards (80%+ coverage)  
✅ Performance guidelines (no frame allocations)  
✅ Error handling (null checks, logging)  
✅ Git practices (atomic commits, clean history)  

### Code Review Gates (Mandatory)
✅ 0 compiler errors (fail condition: > 0)  
✅ 0 compiler warnings (fail condition: > 0)  
✅ 80%+ test coverage (fail condition: < 80%)  
✅ 100% standards compliance (fail condition: < 100%)  
✅ All tests passing (fail condition: any fail)  
✅ Full method documentation (fail condition: incomplete)  

### Enforcement
✅ ME code review required  
✅ 24-hour review SLA  
✅ All checks must pass  
✅ No exceptions (escalate if needed)

## Timeline Impact

### Original Plan (Pre-Acceleration)
```
Nov 14: Sprint 1 complete
Nov 21: Sprint 2 kickoff  ← 1-week gap
Nov 28: Sprint 3 kickoff
...
Jan 9: Launch
```

### Accelerated Plan (Post-Acceleration)
```
Nov 14: Sprint 1 complete, Sprint 2 starts immediately
Nov 20-21: Sprint 2 complete
Nov 21-22: Sprint 3 kickoff
Nov 28: Sprint 3 complete
...
Jan 7-9: Launch (1-2 days earlier possible)
```

### Potential Time Savings
- **If execution perfect**: 1-2 days earlier (Jan 7-8 launch)
- **If normal velocity**: On time (Jan 9 launch)
- **Risk buffer**: Still exists, but compressed

## Risk Assessment (Post-Deployment)

### Current Risks: NONE IDENTIFIED ✅

### Potential Future Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Sprint 2 delayed | High | Low | Daily monitoring, blocker detection |
| Code quality drops | High | Low | Quality gates enforced strictly |
| Team member unavailable | Medium | Low | No current resource risks |
| Scope creep | Medium | Low | Change control gate (ME approval) |
| Performance regression | Medium | Low | Profiling in Sprint 7 |

### Risk Monitoring
✅ Daily standup (blocker detection)  
✅ Weekly review (progress tracking)  
✅ Metrics dashboard (real-time visibility)  
✅ Escalation path (4-hour response SLA)
