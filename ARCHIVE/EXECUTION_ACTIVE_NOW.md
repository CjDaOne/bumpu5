## 🆘 BLOCKER ESCALATION (IMMEDIATE)

**If you get stuck** (any team):

1. **Post immediately** in #documentation or DM ME
2. **Be specific**: What's the exact issue?
3. **ME response**: < 15 minutes guaranteed
4. **ME provides**: Guidance, clarification, or solution
5. **You continue**: Get back to work immediately

**Common blockers & solutions**:
```
"Don't know what to include" → ME gives you 3-5 bullets
"Can't verify accuracy" → ME checks code, confirms
"Running out of time" → Focus on core sections
"Need other team's info" → ME provides or coordinates
```
