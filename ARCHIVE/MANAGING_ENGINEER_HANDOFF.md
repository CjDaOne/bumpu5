## Handoff Notes for Next Managing Engineer Session

### If Tests Pass (Expected)
1. Mark SPRINT_1_COMPLETE.txt
2. Update SPRINT_STATUS.md with test results
3. Formally close Sprint 1
4. Begin Sprint 2 kickoff prep (minor - already done)

### If Tests Fail (Low Probability)
1. Review test output for specific failures
2. Re-examine code in SPRINT_1_REVIEW.md
3. Identify root cause (likely test issue, not code issue)
4. Escalate with specific test name and failure message

### For Sprint 2 Kickoff (Nov 21)
1. Brief Gameplay Engineer on SPRINT_2_BRIEFING.md
2. Walk through state machine diagram
3. Discuss test strategy
4. Establish daily standup cadence
5. Set expectations (22+ tests, 7-day turnaround)

### For Ongoing Management
1. Daily standups (recommend: 9 AM UTC)
2. Weekly sprint review (Friday)
3. Code review every 2-3 days (not blocking, but timely)
4. Update SPRINT_STATUS.md after each sprint day
