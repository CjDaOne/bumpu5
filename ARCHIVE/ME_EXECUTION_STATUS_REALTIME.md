## 🚨 BLOCKER MANAGEMENT

### Blocker Escalation Path
1. **Team Level** (Try first, < 5 min)
   - Resolve within team
   - Quick questions?

2. **ME Level** (< 15 min response)
   - Post in #documentation or DM
   - ME provides guidance
   - Team implements fix

3. **Critical Blocker** (< 30 min escalation)
   - Block is preventing document submission
   - ME takes over: Provide content, team formats
   - OR: Reduce scope & continue

### Common Blockers & Solutions
```
BLOCKER: "Don't know what to include in [section]"
SOLUTION: ME provides 3-4 bullet points, team expands

BLOCKER: "Can't verify accuracy against code"
SOLUTION: ME checks code, provides yes/no confirmation

BLOCKER: "Running out of time"
SOLUTION: Focus on core sections, extend non-critical areas

BLOCKER: "[Other team's] information needed"
SOLUTION: ME coordinates or provides placeholder values
```
