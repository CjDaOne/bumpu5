**From**: Amp (Managing Engineer)  
**To**: Board Engineer Agent  
**Date**: Nov 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ DESIGN PHASE COMPLETE & APPROVED  
**Authority**: IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE AUTHORIZATION

---

## MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

Board system architecture fully designed. All design documents complete and approved. Ready for formal Sprint 4 implementation starting Nov 21.

**Design Deliverables Status**: 6/6 ✅

- ✅ BoardGridManager Architecture design
- ✅ Cell Interaction System design
- ✅ Valid Move Generation Algorithm design
- ✅ Chip Animation System design
- ✅ Board-to-GameState Integration Strategy design
- ✅ Visual Design & Prefab Structure design

- **Integration Points**: Fully mapped to GameStateManager
- **Component Diagrams**: All generated
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: All specified
- **Edge Cases**: All identified & solutions designed
- **Performance Strategy**: Defined for all systems
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Planned for all breakpoints

---

## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

1. **BoardGridManager**: Central orchestrator with cell references cached
2. **Cell Interaction**: Event-driven, validated via GameStateManager
3. **Valid Moves**: Computed by GameStateManager, displayed by Board
4. **Animations**: State-machine based with queue support
5. **Integration**: Observer pattern for state synchronization
