3. **Review documents in rolling fashion** (30 min per doc, no waiting)
4. **Approve fast, support generously** (encourage pace)
5. **Consolidate after 8 PM** (when all approved)

### For All Teams
1. **Read your deployment card** (find your team's specific assignments)
2. **Follow the structure templates** (provided in cards)
3. **Write fast, not perfect** (80% acceptable)
4. **Submit by 6 PM** (hard deadline, no extensions)

## 🔄 EXECUTION DECISION TREE

### If Team is Behind Schedule
**Decision Point**: 2 PM checkpoint, team hasn't started
**Options**:
1. Call team, ask what's blocking (might be simple)
2. Provide guidance or resources
3. Reduce scope if necessary (cut lowest-priority section)
4. Stay focused - most teams will catch up quickly

### If Document Quality is Low on Submission
**Decision Point**: Document submitted but missing sections
**Options**:
1. Provide 3-5 specific feedback items
2. Tell team "resubmit by [time + 30 min] with these fixes"
3. Review again within 15 min of resubmission
4. Approve revised version (assume team will fix)

### If ME Review Process Slows Down
**Decision Point**: 3+ documents in queue, can't keep up
**Options**:
1. Speed up individual reviews (20 min instead of 30)
2. Use secondary reviewer if available
3. Prioritize: Approve good docs, request revision for weak ones
4. Worst case: Extend consolidation start to 9 PM (still finish by midnight)

### If Document is Submitted at 5:45 PM (Close to Deadline)
**Decision Point**: Late submission, tight timeline
**Options**:
1. Review immediately (fast-track)
2. Approve if 80%+ complete
3. Provide feedback if major issues
4. Accept even partial documents rather than miss deadline
5. Complete consolidation still by midnight (tight, but doable)

### If Not All 13 Documents Submitted by 6 PM
**Decision Point**: HARD DEADLINE MISSED
**Options** (in order of preference):
1. **Extend 30 min** (6:00 → 6:30 PM) - last resort only
2. **Scope reduction** - cut lowest-priority sections from missing docs
3. **ME takeover** - if team can't finish, you write from their outline
4. **Publish incomplete** - get as many as possible, complete next day
5. **Skip consolidation** - publish raw docs, consolidate later

```
