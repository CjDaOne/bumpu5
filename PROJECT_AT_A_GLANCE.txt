Every day at 9 AM UTC, ask these 6 questions (15 min total):

1. What did you accomplish yesterday?        (QA: test count, dev: bugs fixed)
2. What are you doing today?                 (QA: next tests, dev: priorities)
3. Do you have blockers?                     (Flag any issues)
4. How does progress look vs. plan?          (On track? At risk? Blocked?)
5. Any platform/environment issues?          (Build, device, tool problems?)
6. What's needed from me?                    (Decisions, unblocking, resources)

Record answers in SPRINT_STATUS.md for documentation.

================================================================================
                      RED FLAGS (ESCALATE NOW)
