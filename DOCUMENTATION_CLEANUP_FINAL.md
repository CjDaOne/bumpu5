5. **MANAGING_ENGINEER_QUICK_INDEX.md** → All content in MANAGING_ENGINEER_OPERATIONS.md
6. **PROJECT_STATUS_UPDATE_NOV14.md** → Superseded by REAL_TIME_PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md
7. **TIMELINE_UPDATE_NOV14.md** → Merged into PROJECT_PLAN.md
8. **DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md** → Duplicate, using CLEANUP_COMPLETE_NOV14.md instead

✅ **No conflicting information** (dates, SLAs, team names consistent)  
✅ **No outdated references** (all point to current docs)  
✅ **No broken links** (all references valid)  
✅ **Single source of truth** for each topic:
- Operations: MANAGING_ENGINEER_OPERATIONS.md
- Coding: CODING_STANDARDS.md  
- Reviews: PROJECT_QUALITY_GATES.md
- Timeline: PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Sprint 2: SPRINT_2_COMPREHENSIVE.md

## Before vs After

### Before Cleanup
- 30+ active documents in root
- 8+ duplicate/overlapping files
- Multiple "status" documents causing confusion
- 4 different Sprint 2 briefing documents
- Unclear which document is "primary source"
- Accumulated daily standup files
- Archived docs still referenced

### After Cleanup
- ✅ 22 focused documents
- ✅ Zero duplication
- ✅ Single source per topic
- ✅ One briefing per sprint
- ✅ Clear primary sources
- ✅ Current sprint standup only
- ✅ ARCHIVE folder isolated

### Benefits
- **Speed**: Faster navigation (fewer docs to search)
- **Clarity**: No ambiguity about which doc to use
- **Consistency**: Single version of truth prevents conflicts
- **Maintenance**: Changes made once, not in 5 places
- **Scalability**: Easy to add sprints following the pattern
- **Professionalism**: Clean, organized documentation

---

## Going Forward: Documentation Rules

### When Creating Documents
❌ **Don't** create multiple briefings for one sprint  
✅ **Do** use SPRINT_N_COMPREHENSIVE.md (single source)

❌ **Don't** keep daily standup files in root permanently  
✅ **Do** archive after sprint ends (SPRINT_STATUS.md is main tracker)

❌ **Don't** duplicate framework/standards info  
✅ **Do** reference MANAGING_ENGINEER_OPERATIONS.md or standards file

❌ **Don't** create "Quick Index" of other docs  
✅ **Do** use DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md for navigation

### When Updating Documents
- Update in ONE place (not multiple duplicates)
- Cross-reference other docs if needed
- Record decision in DECISION_LOG.md if architectural
- Update DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md if adding new docs

### Archive Management
- Move completed sprint docs to ARCHIVE/ (except COMPREHENSIVE.md review)
- Move old daily standups to ARCHIVE/ after sprint ends
- Keep ARCHIVE/ but don't reference it for current work
- Search ARCHIVE/ only for historical context
