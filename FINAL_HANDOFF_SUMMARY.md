## LESSONS LEARNED

### Practices That Worked Exceptionally Well
1. **Daily standups** with structured Q&A format
2. **Severity-based bug SLAs** (CRITICAL <4h, HIGH <24h)
3. **Real-time progress tracking** (PHASE2_DAILY_PROGRESS.md)
4. **Phase gates** with clear decision criteria
5. **Feature freeze** implemented 2+ weeks before release

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Unity 6.0 migration** - Completed successfully in Phase 1 (78/78 pass)
2. **Multiple platforms** - All 3 platforms approved and deployed
3. **Complex game modes** - All 5 modes working correctly with edge case testing
4. **Timeline pressure** - Delivered 10 days early despite complexity

### Recommendations for Future Projects
1. Establish managing engineer role with full decision authority early
2. Implement daily standups from project start (not just final phases)
3. Use severity-based SLAs for all issues (not just critical)
4. Track metrics daily (tests, pass rate, bugs)
5. Enforce strict feature freeze 2-3 weeks before release
6. Schedule phase gates with clear GO/NO-GO criteria
7. Maintain real-time progress tracker (updated continuously)
