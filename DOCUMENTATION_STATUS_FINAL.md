⭐ **SPRINT_2_COMPREHENSIVE.md** - Sprint requirements (daily until Nov 28)  
⭐ **SPRINT_STATUS.md** - Real-time progress (daily)  
⭐ **MANAGING_ENGINEER_OPERATIONS.md** - Operations reference (as needed)

### For One-Time Reference

🔗 **AGENT_ONBOARDING.md** - Agent orientation (first day)  
🔗 **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Project overview (once)  
🔗 **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design (reference as needed)

### For Leadership/Reports

📊 **PROJECT_PLAN.md** - Timeline (weekly review)  
📊 **EXEC_SUMMARY_NOV14.md** - Executive summary (snapshot)

---

## Archive Management

### What's in ARCHIVE/

- Old sprint briefing documents (superseded)
- Daily standup files from completed sprints
- Planning documents from cleanup process
- Historical versions of documents
- One-time briefing documents
- Reference copies of superseded docs

### Archive Usage Rules

✅ **DO**: Search archive for historical context  
✅ **DO**: Use DECISION_LOG.md to understand why decisions were made  
✅ **DO**: Keep archive as project history  

❌ **DON'T**: Reference archive docs for current work  
❌ **DON'T**: Use archived briefings (use active COMPREHENSIVE.md)  
❌ **DON'T**: Follow old planning documents (use latest in root)
