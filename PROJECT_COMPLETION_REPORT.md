## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Well
1. **Daily Standups**: Consistent 9 AM UTC standup with structured Q&A prevented blockers
2. **Bug Triage Framework**: Clear severity classifications and SLAs enabled fast resolution
3. **Test-Driven Development**: 90%+ code coverage caught issues early
4. **Phase Gates**: Nov 29 Phase 2→3 gate and Dec 15 release gate provided clear decisions
5. **Team Discipline**: Feature freeze from Nov 21 protected timeline

### Key Success Factors
- Clear decision authority (Managing Engineer had autonomy)
- Real-time tracking (PHASE2_DAILY_PROGRESS.md kept team synchronized)
- Proactive communication (Slack channels, EOD reports)
- Quality first (91% pass rate demonstrates confidence)
- Schedule discipline (no scope creep, protected Dec 15 date)

### Recommendations for Future Projects
1. Maintain daily standups throughout project lifecycle
2. Use severity-based SLAs for bug fixes (Critical <4h, High <24h)
3. Implement phase gates with clear GO/NO-GO criteria
4. Enforce feature freeze 2-3 weeks before release
5. Track metrics daily (tests, pass rate, bugs by severity)
6. Have managing engineer with full decision authority during final phases
